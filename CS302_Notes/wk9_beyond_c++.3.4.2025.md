### Java

No operator overloading 
No user defined type conversions
No explicit pointers
Garbage Collection - no delete, or destructors
References instead of explicit pointers no pass by reference

##### C++  Similarities:
bool is boolean
same data types available
semi-colons are used similarly
C++ loops, conditionals, variables, functions
Arrays are pointers to the first element
Arrays from index 0 through size - 1

##### Minor C++ Differences:
No explicit pointers
No scope resolution, sizeof
##### Major C++ Differences:
No global realm
Classes are all written inside, no interface (.h) separate from implementation
No semicolon after class
No operator overloading
0 is not false
Every field and method has public/private/protected
Private members first

Static methods
Main
	placements, arguments 
Notion of current object existing
