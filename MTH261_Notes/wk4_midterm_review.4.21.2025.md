1. Consistent vs. Inconsistent - Solution exists vs. no solution (i.e. a row expresses 0 = 1 )
2. Augmented vs. Coefficient: Augmented contains coefficient representing left side and constant for right side. Coefficient can be represented without variables because the multiplication is implied.
3. Gaussian Elimination: 
	1. Create a row 1 with leading 1
	2. Create diagonal of leading 1s through elementary row operations
	3. To create reduced row form, leading 1s must be only nonzero in each column.
4. Homogeneous and non-homogeneous: homogeneous is where the constant matrix is all 0s. If there is at least one nonzero solution, it is non-homogeneous.
5. Trivial vs. Nontrivial Solutions: Trivial solution is where all constants are 0s. For a matrix with a unique solution, there will only be a trivial solution.
6. Basis solution means the solution is represented by parameters.
7. Inverse is $\frac{1}{determinant}(adjugate)$. Given matrices A and C, if AC and CA both equal identity matrix, they are inverse of one another.
8. Determinant is top left times bottom right minus opposite corners
9.  Or, can use coefficient matrix on left and identity on right, then perform row operations to switch identity and coefficient. 
10. To solve a matrix by finding the inverse, we can multiply the inverse by both sides to eliminate the matrix and get an identity on the left, with solutions on the right.
