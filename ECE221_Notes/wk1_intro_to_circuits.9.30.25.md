## Class 1
**Charge**: electrical property of the atomic particles of which matter consists, measured in Coulombs (C).
**Electric current**: is the time rate of change of charge measured in Amps, Coulombs per second (I)
**Voltage**: a measure of potential difference in charge, the energy required to move a charge.

The purpose of this class is reasoning, not memorizing and reciting definitions.

**Circuit Elements**: Resistor, inducter, capacitor, and operational amplifier

Learn concepts deeply and explain in own words
Apply concepts of analysis
Use instruments to make and test circuits

How to learn:
1. Attend class and labs, know the topics of the day participate actively in the class and labs, ask questions, take class notes, keep lab work and results.
2. Allocate additional 7-10 hours weekly, take notes of own study
3. Update Notebook weekly with all learning in the week
4. At the end of the term, submit circuit notebook and schedule Q & A to present
5. There is a final comprehensive exam.

## Class 2
How does current move?
Are the electrons moving or putting pressure on one another?

**Example**: Simple circuit, battery, copper wire, and in the middle of the circuit, a tungsten filament. 
- Difference in potential between separated electrodes on the battery creates a flow of energy
- When the circuit is closed, the energy flows - pushing and exciting the electrons of the wire
- The rate of flow of electrons is constant
- Assuming the density is constant as well, when the cross section of the wire decreases as we go from the wire to the filament, the velocity must increase.
- Because of the velocity increase, temperature will increase and the energy spent there must increase to increase the velocity

Why does the tungsten have more control over the flow rate of energy?
Does the energy remain constant or is some released?
Voltage means 1 Coulomb (C) produces how many Joules (J)? $V = \frac{J}{C}$ 

The tungsten controls the flow rate. Assuming the energy to be spent remains the same, (Joules/Coulomb = Volts), what happens as the tungsten changes?
If the length of the tungsten filament increases, the flow rate will decrease. There will be a lower velocity through the whole loop.

What is the energy at different points in the circuit?

## Homework 1
Suppose the filament is made to have a cross sectional area that is 1/2 its current size. What would be the effect on the current (rate of flow)? The current cannot remain the same for the circuit. If it did, the drift velocity would be increased (doubled) to maintain the same rate of flow if the area is half. Increased velocity would mean there is greater energy being supplied, and this is not the case.

If the filament shrinks to nothing, the rate of flow too will shrink to 0.

Suppose the filament was made twice as long instead, leaving the cross sectional area of the original filament unchanged.

1. If the length doubled, the current will be reduced as well because a single cross-section of tungsten will restrict the current flow so that the charges don't "stack up". Since the cross section is unchanged and the charge flow rate is slowed at the first instant of transition, it must remain that way for longer. Since the smaller cross section doesn't speed up the flow, it restricts it, it will be restricted for longer. A larger percentage of the circuit is this fine filament, so it must push through a more "restive" path for twice as long.

2. As one coulomb of charge flows through this new circuit, the total energy supplied is the same, but the energy used is greater because a larger percentage of the circuit is made of a material that is more resistant to charges moving.
## Note About Electricity, Abstractions, and Flow
https://www.douglaskrantz.com/ElecElectricalFlow.html
Very interesting thoughts about convention vs. scientific reality and why we can think of current as flowing from the positive terminal.
1. Does the positive charge move from the positive terminal at the same or different speed from the electrons? 
2. Why might the rate be different?
3. While electrons are physically moving, positive charge is what? A wave? 
4. Magnetic vs. electric sense of positive/negative
5. Lightning starts at the positively charged ground and transfers charge to negative ions in the air, "climbing" up
6. Why can an agreement not be reached on what is electricity? Technician vs. Engineer perspective and where does the electron flow vs. conventional current flow make a difference?
